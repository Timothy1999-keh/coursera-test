	Nowadays, file sharing, especially peer-to-peer or P2P file sharing has become an activity that people in my country do everyday. File sharing programs or applications like zapya, xender, vidmate, etc are usually used to share and download music, videos, movies, images and all that. There are also many websites in the internet where we can download updated movies and songs from different resources. I'm also one of the people who does that everyday. I usually download songs from applications and movies from websites.
	Actually, it isn't a good thing since we're sharing and downloading files without paying for them or getting permission from the copyright owner. P2P programs and applications are often used to distribute or share files without the permission of the copyright holder. So, it is somehow harmful for them. According to the copyright law of U.S, you can be sentenced to fine between $750 and $150,000 depending on your infringement. As my opinion, if there are strict rules and laws for file sharing and copyright in my country and if it really harms or damages the copyright holder and the producers of music and films a lot, I will stop doing it.
